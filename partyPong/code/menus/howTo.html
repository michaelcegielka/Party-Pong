      <h1>Create Game</h1>

        <p>
          By clicking on 'Create Game' players open a game room, which will be listed in the
          lobby together with their name. In addition to that, the creator is asked to 
          <a href="#calibrate" class="jump">calibrate</a>
          his playing axis. After doing so, the player probably needs to wait for an opponent
          to join and start the game. <br>
        </p>

      <h1>Join Game</h1>

        <p>
          To join a game players choose an open game from the lobby list. After deciding on a room,
          they will be asked to <a href="#calibrate" class="jump">calibrate</a> their playing axis and to start the game, when they're
          ready. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
          When players need to calibrate their playing axis, they will be shown their current location.
          If the location provides about 100 meters of free space, it is suitable for playing the game.
          Consequently the player can press 'Play Here'. <br> <br>
          By doing so, the playing axis will become visible. In order to fit the free space, it can be 
          rotated with the slider in the bottom half of the screen. If the free space is not big enough,
          players can change locations and press 'Play Here' again. Players that are satisfied with the
          orientation of their playing axis can press 'Start Game'. <br>

        <p>
          The game works just like the popular video game Pong, the only difference being that players move
          their paddles by running back and forth in real life. The paddles can block the ball and stop the
          opponent from scoring. Whoever scores more points wins the game. <br>
